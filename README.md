# What's Included
### The Basics:
* *core/src/com/mygdx/game/* **MyGdxGame**
    * The classic LibGDX main game class. <br>You'll find ~~helpful comments~~ *(60% done)* and code 
    very similar to what you got while following the tutorial. I invite you to take a good, long look at the
     syntax of the Socket object you will interact with, as there are some slight differences. 
     Featured events: *"connect"*, *"socketID"*, and a bonus *"pong"* event further showcasing how 
     to retrieve sent data.
    
* *server/* **index.js**
    * The basic Node.JS server.<br> Nothing here you didn't see in the tutorial, but you'll also have to 
    look at this file to understand what's going on. Featured events: *"connection"*, *"socketID"*, 
    "*disconnect*", a bonus *"myPing"* (***fun fact***: *"ping"* is a reserved event name, so we can't use it).
